# YNAB MCP Reconciliation Workflow Enhancements

This file tracks the development plan for improving the account reconciliation process.

## TODO List

- [x] **1. Enhance Foundational Transaction Tools:**
  - Modify `create_transaction`, `update_transaction`, and `delete_transaction` to return the updated `balance` and `cleared_balance` of the affected account in their response.

- [x] **2. Enhance Comparison Tool:**
  - [x] Add automatic payee lookup/suggestion feature.
  - [x] Investigate and fix any further reported bugs (e.g., incorrect counts):
    - [x] Fixed schema validation bug preventing default csv_format from working
    - [x] Fixed YNAB transaction count bug (was returning 0, now correctly returns actual count)
    - [x] Verified perfect matching accuracy (100% match rate in testing)
    - [x] Both default and explicit csv_format scenarios now work correctly

- [x] **3. Implement High-Level Reconciliation Tool:**
  - [x] Create a new `reconcile_account` tool that encapsulates the entire iterative reconciliation logic.
  - [x] This tool leverages the enhanced foundational tools from the previous steps.
  - [x] Comprehensive workflow including transaction comparison, creation, and status updates.
  - [x] Full integration with MCP server and successful testing with real YNAB data.
  - [x] Features include dry-run mode, automatic transaction creation, cleared status updates, and detailed reporting.
