---

## Priority 4: Lower Priority / Future Considerations

### 11. Scheduled Jobs & Routine Exports

**Status**: Not prioritized (architectural mismatch)
**Reason**: MCP servers are typically on-demand, not long-running

- Would require significant architecture changes
- Can be handled by external cron jobs

### 12. Multi-Budget Transaction Transfer

**Status**: Not prioritized (edge case)
**Reason**: YNAB doesn't officially support this

- Edge case use case
- Can be done manually with export/import

### 13. Goal Tracking Tools

**Status**: Not prioritized (less commonly used)
**Reason**: YNAB web/mobile already handle this well

- Tools to view, create, update goals
- Complex to implement well
- Less commonly used than core budgeting

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items:

1. **Breaking Changes**: MoneyValue could break existing consumers
   - **Mitigation**: Version flag, gradual rollout
2. **Execution Phase Bugs**: Data modification is risky
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, dry-run default, rollback capability

### Medium Risk Items:

1. **Performance Regression**: New features could slow things down
   - **Mitigation**: Performance instrumentation first, profile continuously
2. **Test Coverage Gaps**: E2E scenarios not fully tested
   - **Mitigation**: Fixture-based tests, real-world validation

### Low Risk Items:

1. **Documentation Drift**: Docs may not match implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Update docs with each feature release

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week):

1. ✅ Fix 5 failing tests in reconciliation matcher
2. ✅ Validate v0.10.0 works correctly with real YNAB data
3. ✅ Run full testing checklist to identify any regressions

### Short-Term (Next Month):

1. Complete MoneyValue + Dual-Channel output improvements
2. Finish reconciliation v2 execution phase
3. Validate with real-world reconciliation scenarios

### Medium-Term (Next Quarter):

1. Implement performance instrumentation
2. Build `ynab-mcp doctor` CLI
3. Add auto-categorization rules
4. Complete fixture-based test suite

### Long-Term (6-12 Months):

1. Implement all high-impact features
2. Build comprehensive tool catalog
3. Add reconciliation health metrics
4. Complete ADR documentation

---

## Questions for Decision

1. **Priority Order**: Should we complete reconciliation v2 first, or start high-impact features in parallel?
2. **Breaking Changes**: How should we handle MoneyValue migration? Version flag or dual-output?
3. **Testing Strategy**: How much E2E testing is needed before shipping execution phase?
4. **Resource Allocation**: What's the budget for these features (weeks/months)?
5. **User Feedback**: Should we ship v2 analysis-only first and get feedback before building execution?

---

## Conclusion

The project has a **substantial amount of planned but unimplemented work**. The reconciliation v2 is partially complete (analysis phase shipped, execution pending), and there's a comprehensive roadmap of high-impact features waiting to be built.

**Key Takeaway**: The project is in good shape technically, but has an ambitious roadmap that will require 6-12 months of focused development to complete.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize completing reconciliation v2 fully before starting new high-impact features. This ensures users get a complete, polished reconciliation experience rather than multiple partially-complete features.

**Document Status**: Complete
**Next Review**: After completing reconciliation v2 execution phase
