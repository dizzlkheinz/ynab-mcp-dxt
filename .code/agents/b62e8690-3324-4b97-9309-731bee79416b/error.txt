Command failed: Error loading configuration: config profile `Plan improvements for docs/reconciliation-flow.md. Context: ynab-mcp-dxt repo, docs reside under docs/, code under src/, Vitest tests in src/__tests__, Prettier 2-space and ESLint enforce style. The reconciliation flow doc already describes prerequisites, schema, configuration knobs, logging, six execution steps, and testing hooks. It lists open questions about persisting detected CSV format, adaptive confidence thresholds, exposing dry-run previews, enforcing statement_date, triggering escalations for large leftovers, and telemetry snapshot privacy. Goal: craft an actionable numbered plan describing concrete documentation edits, decisions on theses open questions (resolve, defer, or call out follow-up), cross-link requirements (docs/schemas/reconciliation-v2.json, reference/API.md#reconcile_account, reference/TOOLS.md#reconcile_account, guides/TESTING.md), and verification guidance (formatting/linting/tests). Prefer incremental updates over full rewrites and keep automation behavior accurate.
