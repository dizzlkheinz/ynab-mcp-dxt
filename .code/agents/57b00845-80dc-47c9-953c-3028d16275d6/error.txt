We need a detailed implementation plan for the automated reconciliation workflow described in docs/reconciliation-flow.md. Focus on translating the narrative into actionable engineering steps: schema enforcement via ReconcileAccountSchema, CSV normalization/window detection enhancements, Phase 1 newest→oldest driver, Phase 2 sanity pass, finalize/audit flow, and leftover reporting. Reference existing repo structure (src/server, src/tools, src/utils) and note where new code or refactors should land, potential dependencies, data models, and testing strategy using Vitest. Call out logging, tolerances, and audit trail considerations. Propose milestones with rationale and checkpoints. Output should be a concise, structured plan ready for execution.
