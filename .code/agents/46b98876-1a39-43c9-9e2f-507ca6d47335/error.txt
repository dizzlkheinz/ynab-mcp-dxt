Repository guidelines: docs live under docs/, TypeScript source in src/, tests under src/__tests__ using Vitest, commands like npm run dev/build/test, formatting with Prettier (2-space indent, 100 cols) and ESLint. Documentation changes should highlight verification steps and cross-linking to reference docs.

Target file: docs/reconciliation-flow.md (Automated Reconciliation Flow). Current content already outlines prerequisites, schema/data contracts, configuration knobs, logging/auditability, six numbered steps (input validation, statement pass, sanity pass, finalize, leftover escalation, telemetry), and testing hooks. Each step lists rationale, what happens, validation, and open questions. Open issues include: whether to persist detected CSV formats, adaptive confidence thresholds, previewing un-cleared transactions in dry-run, enforcing statement_date, escalation hooks for leftover volume, telemetry snapshot privacy.

Task: produce an actionable improvement plan for updating docs/reconciliation-flow.md so it stays authoritative for engineers and assistant builders. Consider structure, clarity, missing cross references, how to resolve or capture the open questions, alignment with schemas (docs/schemas/reconciliation-v2.json, reference/API.md#reconcile_account, reference/TOOLS.md#reconcile_account), and ensuring testing guidance matches current tooling (test-reconcile-*.js, npm run test:comprehensive). Identify concrete edits, data you would need, and validation steps. Prefer lightweight, iterative documentation changes over large rewrites. Output: numbered plan with rationale for each step, referencing specific sections/subsections to touch, and proposed verification (e.g., linting/formatting checks).

Deliver rich reasoning so we can synthesize multiple viewpoints later.
