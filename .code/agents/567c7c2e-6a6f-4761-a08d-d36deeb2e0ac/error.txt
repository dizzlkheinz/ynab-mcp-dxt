Current reference: docs/reconciliation-flow.md (Automated Reconciliation Flow covering validation, phase 1 newest→oldest pass, phase 2 sanity pass, finalize, leftovers, implementation backlog). New vdocs page must include: 1) front matter + navigation metadata, 2) prerequisites/env + services + .env/YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN requirements, 3) data contracts (ReconcileAccountSchema fields, CSV parsing outputs, intermediate cleared_delta state, audit log payloads), 4) step-by-step algorithm phases with success/abort criteria, 5) configuration knobs (amount tolerances, ±5-day drift, confidence thresholds, automation toggles), 6) logging/audit + reporting expectations, 7) leftover escalation UX + reporting, 8) testing hooks (Vitest suites under src/__tests__, fixtures in test-exports/, test-results artifacts) and cross-links to src/tools/** files. Deliverable: plan only, no final prose. List repo files to inspect for each step and any open questions/validation tasks.

Agent: Develop a detailed plan (ordered steps, each with rationale) for authoring vdocs/reconciliation-flow.md.
