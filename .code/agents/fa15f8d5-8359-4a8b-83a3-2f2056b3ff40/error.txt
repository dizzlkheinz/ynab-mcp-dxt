Command failed: Error loading configuration: config profile `You are helping document improvements for docs/reconciliation-flow.md in the YNAB MCP DXT repo (TypeScript MCP host). The doc currently explains the automated reconciliation flow (prereqs, schema/contracts, configuration knobs, logging/auditability, six numbered steps, testing hooks). We need a concrete, multi-step plan for editing this document so it becomes clearer, aligned with src/tools/reconciliation/*, and highlights validation plus troubleshooting entry points. Consider structure (TOC, numbered steps, diagrams/ASCII where helpful), schema references to modules (ReconcileAccountSchema, buildReconciliationPayload, executor, etc.), missing sections (failures/escalation, telemetry, examples), and verification work (tests/docs crosslinks). Produce bullet/numbered steps with rationale, pointing to relevant code/docs. Follow repository guidelines (2-space indent, Prettier, lint, Vitest).
