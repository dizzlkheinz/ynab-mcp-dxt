Command failed: Error loading configuration: config profile `Need an ordered action plan for building vdocs/reconciliation-flow.md in repo ynab-mcp-dxt. Existing reference text is docs/reconciliation-flow.md describing automated reconciliation flow (input validation, phase 1 newest->oldest matching, phase 2 sanity pass, finalize, escalate leftovers, backlog). Target vdocs page must add front matter, prerequisites, data contracts (ReconcileAccountSchema etc), flow diagrams/placeholders, success/abort criteria, configuration knobs (+/-5 day drift, tolerances, confidence thresholds), logging/audit requirements, leftover escalation detail, testing hooks, and cross-links to src/tools + src/utils. Output should be steps with rationale, referencing relevant files and validation tasks, plus open questions.
