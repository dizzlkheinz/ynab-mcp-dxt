Command failed: Error loading configuration: config profile `Context: Repository: ynab-mcp-dxt (TypeScript MCP host, docs in docs/, tests via Vitest). Target file docs/reconciliation-flow.md documents the automated YNAB reconciliation flow with sections on prerequisites, schema/data contracts, configuration knobs, logging/auditability, six execution steps (each with rationale/validation/open questions), and testing hooks. Open questions include persisting CSV format hints, adaptive confidence thresholds, dry-run previews, statement_date enforcement, SLA/escalations, and telemetry snapshots. Writing conventions: Prettier 2-space indent, 100-char width, relative doc links. Goal: produce a numbered plan (5-8 steps) detailing how to update the doc for clarity, operator readiness, and cross-link accuracy. Each step should cover objectives, concrete edits/research (e.g., confirm schema details in src/tools/reconciliation/index.ts, reference docs/guides/TESTING.md), dependencies/stakeholders, and acceptance criteria. Note any diagrams/tables or validation artifacts to add. Treat this as the blueprint before editing the file.

Agent: Develop a multistep improvement plan for docs/reconciliation-flow.md
